## Dagda: Celtic Heroes World Editor

This program is a visual editor for Celtic Heroes' database. It is simply a SQL generator that enables small edits to quests, items, mobs, and more. It aims to cover many general-purpose use cases, however anything extensive should use the actual world creator tools.

*NOTE: This tool uses educated guesses of the actual functionality of Celtic Heroes. It is not intended for use with the live game, and will not work for the live game. This is just a fun side project to learn SQL and basic UI/UX. The Celtic Heroes developers are welcome to use this tool for the live game, however its purpose is strictly educational.*
